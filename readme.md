Embedded linux

Assignment one.

Run progA.c with two mandatory flags, namely -r and -s. Both flags have an expected value, -r representes the repitition with progB and -s is the size of the shared memory. For example, if program A should run something 5 times with programB and the size of the shared memory has to be 20  bytes, then

./outputProgA -r 5 -s 20

The -h flag can be used optionally for extra help. No parameters are necessary.
